This is my version of an algorithm sorting visualizer. The idea was inspired by and based on Clement Mihalescu's version using a simple React app and HTML display elements. 

Details of sorting algorithms used:

Merge Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort
Quick Sort (Last element pivot): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort
Heap Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort
Bubble Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
